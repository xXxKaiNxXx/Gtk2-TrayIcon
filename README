README for Gtk2::TrayIcon

This module allows a Perl developer to embed an arbitrary widget in a
System Tray like the Gnome notification area.

It requires the Gtk2 modules to be installed, but includes the code for
libeggtray which it wraps.

Install as allways.

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
